When I am not working, I am helping my wife raise our children, volunteering at my church (the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) as a 


bishopric counselor, cooking, reading books, listening to books and podcasts, tweeting, or (very occasionally) blogging. I am an advocate of intermittent 


fasting and low-carbohydrate dieting. 
I am a LaTeX enthusiast and enjoy following sports and doing sports analytics for fun. My favorite teams are: BYU, OU, Chelsea FC, Duke, and the Utah Jazz.
